            This is a game and the rules are simple. Two players per team, and
            they must help transport our precious cargo from the past into the
            future.
          </p>
          <p>
            The briefcase is a time capsule, it is our dear inventory full of
            relics. It is the sum of a moment in time represented by the
            possessions of its contributors. It is freight waiting to be moved
            to its final destination.
          </p>
          <p>
            A long time ago it would have been sufficient to bury it in the
            ground and call it a day. But now urban development moves too
            quickly and the ground is constantly dug up and overturned and then
            dug up all over again.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have therefore entrusted our precious cargo with willing
            participants, people to look after it and take responsibility for
            its safety. We hire real people so that there&apos;s someone to
            take the fall if anything goes wrong.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can play too, but first you need a partner, someone you trust as
            a fellow smuggler. For multiple reasons:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>This is a pas de deux</li>
            <li>The world was built for two</li>
            <li>
              One person can’t look in multiple directions at the same time
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            So protect the cargo at all costs and don’t take from it until the
            time is right. You do not yet understand why its contents are
            illegal but you will in one hundred years time. Besides, by the time
            you enter the game you might not even know what’s inside of it. Most
            of the players never will, they devote themselves to our mission
            with blind faith.
          </p>
          <p>
            Movement in any direction is valid, so long the briefcase moves
            forward through time. We seek to play the long game.
